# Codsoft Calculator

A simple web-based calculator created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project is a part of the Codsoft internship/task submissions.

## Features

- Fully responsive calculator UI
- Supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Clear display with `AC` button
- Delete last character with `DEL` button
- Real-time calculations using JavaScript `eval()` function
- Stylish and modern design with CSS grid layout and flexbox

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - Markup for the calculator structure
- **CSS3** - Styling and layout design
- **JavaScript** - Logic for calculator operations and event handling

## Code Overview

- `HTML` creates the structure, including display and buttons.
- `CSS` styles the calculator for a modern dark theme.
- `JavaScript` handles button clicks and performs calculations:
  - `AC` clears the entire input.
  - `DEL` deletes the last character.
  - `=` evaluates the current expression.

## Note

This project uses `eval()` for simplicity. In production-level applications, it's recommended to implement a custom parser to handle calculations securely.
